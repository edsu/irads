Ad Text NOT EVERY BOY WANTS TO BE A SOLDIER.
A beautiful message was seen on the streets of the capitol, with no group
name or credits attached to the project.

It was the poster at top, of the bearded man in a pink gown behaving like a
queen and holding a sign saying "Not every boy wants to be a soldier". A
timely message for today.

The two recent US. wars were costly for our nation, to put it lightly. They led
to domestic devastation of country. No matter what Defense Secretary or
POTUS are saying they don't fool me with promises of gay military equality as
key to the nation's agenda. Better talk to me about cutting DoD's budget,
FOLKS.
